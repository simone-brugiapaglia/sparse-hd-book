This is a repository associated with the book:

Sparse Polynomial Approximation of High-Dimensional Functions
by Ben Adcock, Simone Brugiapaglia and Clayton G. Webster

to be published by SIAM in late 2021. It contains Matlab scripts to generate all figures in the book. 

## Contacting the authors

If you have questions or comments about the code, or would like to view a draft copy of the manuscript, please contact ben_adcock@sfu.ca or simone.brugiapaglia@concordia.ca.

## Code organization

Files are organized into four main directories:

utils
Contains various Matlab functions needed across main scripts

src
Contains the main Matlab files used to create figures in each chapter
Organized in chapters

data
Contains .mat files generated by the scripts in src
Organized in chapters

figs
Contains .eps files generated by the scripts in src
Organized in chapters

Filenames
These generically take the form 

fig_[chpt][number]_[col] or figs_[chpt][number1]_[chpt][number2]_[row]_[col] 

where [chpt] is the chapter number, [number], [number1] and [number2] are the figure numbers and [row] and [col] are the row number and column number is multi-panel figures.
